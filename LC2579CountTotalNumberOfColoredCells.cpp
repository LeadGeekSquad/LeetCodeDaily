            intuition:
            - this should be fairly simple to think of
            - after 1st minute, we can notice that from 2nd minute upto the nth minute it is doubling by 4
            - so after 1st minute, it would be growing linearly like 4,8,12,16,20....k+4
            - so at every minute after 1st minute, we just keep adding those doubling values to our answer
            - To optimize it to solve in constant time O(1), we can just use the formula 1+2n(nâˆ’1)
